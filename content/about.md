<h2 class="cm-team-about-details-title mb-20">Beginning</h2>
<p class="mb-30">In 1990, I moved to the United States and eventually met my future wife. After we got married, I worked at a nightclub for a while, 
but I knew in my heart that it wasn't the life for me. I enrolled in college to improve my English and decided to follow my calling: 
I started massage therapy school. In 1996, I graduated from the Chicago School of Massage Therapy. </p>

<h2 class="cm-team-about-details-title mb-20">First client</h2>
<p class="mb-30">One of my very first clients was a 50-year-old woman in Glencoe, a suburb north of Chicago. She had suffered from severe headaches for years, 
and her daughter had given her a massage gift certificate for her birthday. After the session, her headaches improved significantly. 
She asked me to come back five more times in the next two weeks. A month later, her neurologist called to congratulate me on the results. </p>

<h2 class="cm-team-about-details-title mb-20">Continued education</h2>
<p class="mb-30">Over the next six months, that same neurologist referred many more patients to me and most of them did very well. A year later, 
she encouraged me to deepen my understanding of upper body treatments for headaches. That advice changed everything. Over the next few years, 
I immersed myself in continuing education. I studied craniosacral therapy at the Upledger Institute, pain relief methods at the St. John Institute, 
and spine mechanics at the McKenzie Institute. My results improved, and my practice became busier than ever. But I still felt something was missing. 
That's when I discovered osteopathic manual therapy. I enrolled at the Osteopathic College of Ontario, where I studied under Dr. Steve Sanet, 
an American-trained osteopathic physician. His approach was grounded in science, yet he practiced with a kind of magic I couldn't explain. 
He told me: "Use OMT with every patient." That single sentence changed my life. With OMT, my results with headache patients became consistently 
effective, and I saw dramatic improvements in treating neck and back pain.</p> 

<h2 class="cm-team-about-details-title mb-20">Last resort</h2>
<p class="mb-30">After graduation and completing my internship, I began treating everyone: friends, nurses, co-workers. The more complex the case, 
the more motivated I felt. Soon, I had a full patient base of people who trusted me. I made them a simple promise: 
"If you're not better after treatment, I won't take your money." My patients include older adults with chronic arthritis, young professionals 
with poor posture, children with headaches, and women with fibromyalgia or neurological pain. 
Many of them come to me as a last resort, after traditional medicine has failed them. If we see progress after a few treatments, we continue. 
If not, we stop. But very often, we do see improvement and that brings hope. I don't try to "sell" OMT or convince anyone to believe in what I do. 
I let the results speak for themselves. Especially with headache and migraine patients—people who've seen doctor after doctor, been given 
different diagnoses, and tried endless medications. They don't always understand what I do. Some even call me a chiropractor. I don't correct them. 
All they care about is one thing: "Can you help me?". I used to avoid hanging my diplomas. Eventually, my children had them framed for my birthday. 
I hang anatomy charts instead so I can show my patients where their pain lives in their body. </p>

<h2 class="cm-team-about-details-title mb-20">Cost effective</h2>
<p class="mb-30">Sometimes a patient asks, "Are you a doctor?" I smile and say, "Not as far as I know." I never guarantee results. 
I only ask: "Why are you here?". Often, it's because they've been to many others without relief. So I say: "Then give me a chance." 
Logic and a little humor go a long way. Working independently isn't easy. 
Insurance companies, lawyers, and third-party rules create confusion. But patients are becoming more informed. They come in with questions 
after reading online. In the past, people just followed what the doctor said. Today, they're looking for someone who listens. 
The medical system still relies heavily on expensive tests, MRIs, x-rays, costing thousands. Meanwhile, a skilled manual exam can be just as, 
if not more, valuable and cost-effective. I've seen a patient hospitalized for chest pain after shoveling snow, it turned out to be a 
rib out of place, something no one thought to check by hand. I've seen headache patients get every test imaginable without anyone asking 
about jaw problems or sleeping posture. Over half my patients with headaches are also on antidepressants, yet no one has placed hands on them 
to evaluate their musculoskeletal system. That is a failure of care. If 90% of headaches are tension related, as the NIH once stated, 
then hands-on evaluation should be the first step, not the last. I've worked with many physicians, some of whom I treated myself. 
I even treated their spouses, children, and friends. One day, a doctor came in, bent over in pain. I treated him, and he played the 
best tennis match of his life the next day. Doctors make the worst patients, but they're still people in need of healing. When other 
therapists ask me to teach OMT, I always start simple. </p>

<h2 class="cm-team-about-details-title mb-20">Less is more</h2>
<p class="mb-30">My motto is: “Less is more.” A positive experience will lead them to use it again. 
But if it's too complicated, or the result isn't good, they may give up forever. There's a deep connection that comes from treating someone 
with your hands. If you're a physician or therapist who listens and touches, really touches, a patient in pain, you're doing something deeply human. 
You're telling them, "I care." One of my most unforgettable patients was a man with stage 4 lung cancer. He had only months to live. 
He came in not for a cure, but to sleep better, his postnasal drip and back pain were unbearable. I treated his neck to relieve pressure 
on his sinuses. At the next visit, he said, "Thank you. I finally slept." That was enough. Osteopathy is well respected around the world, 
especially in countries where it's practiced without drugs or surgery. Sadly, in the U.S., touch-based medicine still feels foreign to 
many physicians. Most doctors care deeply. But medical training focuses on diagnosis and prescriptions. My message to every physician is simple: 
Take five minutes. Place your hands on your patient. Try a few simple techniques. You'll find that touch is not just a tool, it's a form of 
communication. It shows compassion. It builds trust. And it might just change your life, the way it changed mine.</p>
