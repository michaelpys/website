**Patient Mary**

"My temples throb and the pain shoots across my forehead and back toward my ears. It feels as
if my head is in a vice grip that is being continuously tightened. When this happens, I generally
go to bed and isolate myself from all light and sound, but it's happening so often I'm spending
most of my life in bed."

"How long have you been suffering like this?" I ask my patient.
{{< break >}}
"For about 30 years."

"Have you sought medical help?"
{{< break >}}
"I've been to twelve different doctors, three headache clinics and have been hospitalized twice."
"Did that help?"
{{< break >}}
"Well, the medicine they said I needed to take eased the pain a little but as the migraine got worse, I was given stronger and stronger doses and put on more medicines which made me so nauseous. Some made me dizzy; others made my vision blurry and this strange ringing in my ears. Even with the medicine I still have migraine and they're getting worse each year. I'm just so tired of dealing with them. I have to get some relief.

My cousin's wife said you helped her, and I want to see if you can do the same for me. She rarely has migraines now and when she does, they are very mild. She takes very little, if any, medicine and she now has her life back. I want the same.

Sadly, every medication Mary was taking to "prevent" her headache attacks were only treating her symptoms. Yes, medication can help manage symptoms, but they do not cure headaches because they do not focus on the cause of the pain. Mary was far too young for this amount of suffering. She was sick of her condition and developed other health issues from the medication, yet she was still dependent on it.

I see patients like Mary who have been diagnosed as having different types of headaches by different doctors. These patients have had headaches anywhere from once a month to 3-4 times a week to those who have lived with daily headaches for many years. And many suffer from nausea, light sensitivity, dizziness and other symptoms associated with head pain. I have found that many of these patients experience transformative results from neck treatment. And they often ask, "Why didn't my doctors tell me about this kind of treatment?"
