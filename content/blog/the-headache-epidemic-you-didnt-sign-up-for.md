Picture this: It's Monday morning, you're sipping your coffee, and bam—there it is again. That
familiar throb in your temples, like a tiny drummer boy who's had too much espresso. Or maybe
it's a full-on migraine, turning your world into a blurry, nausea-filled nightmare. Sound familiar?
You're not alone. Headaches are a universal plague, striking millions worldwide with the
precision of a tax deadline. They don't care if you're a CEO, a barista, or a stay-at-home
parent—they'll crash your party regardless.

Here's the kicker: despite their prevalence, most headache treatments are like putting a Band-Aid
on a leaky pipe. Pills might dull the pain for a bit, but they don't fix the source. And alternative
therapies? Well, they're often a roll of the dice—sometimes you win, sometimes you're left
rubbing essential oils on your forehead while chanting affirmations. (No judgment if that's your
thing, though!)

But what if I told you there's a better way? A way that doesn't involve popping pills like candy
or hoping your lavender candle holds the secret to relief? Enter the Pys Headache Method, a
game-changer I've honed over 30 years as an osteopathic manual therapist. This isn't about
masking symptoms—it's about digging into the root cause, which, spoiler alert, is often hiding in
your neck.
