Head pain is your body's way of sending a message: something needs attention. But instead of listening to that message, we often silence it with medication—numbing the pain and mistaking that for a cure.

It's important to remember: there is no medication, injection, or surgical procedure that cures the root cause of most headaches. These treatments address symptoms, not the underlying problem.

In my 30 years as an osteopathic manual therapist, I've never seen a patient suddenly develop migraines—unless there was a serious health issue or history of concussion. Most patients describe a slow progression: their headaches began years ago as mild tension, gradually growing worse over time.

This pattern is common. When the cause of a headache is ignored and only the symptoms are treated with medication, the pain tends to become more intense—even as the dosage increases.

In many cases, the root cause is chronic muscle dysfunction in the neck, which can irritate or sensitize the brainstem. If left untreated, this tension spreads. Over time, the neck joints become involved, pulling on the vertebrae and triggering more frequent, more severe headaches.

The longer this dysfunction is left unaddressed, the more likely a person is to develop migraines.

The good news is: **relief is possible.** Osteopathic Manual Therapy (OMT) can help resolve the underlying muscular and joint issues contributing to your headaches. And once your pain is under control, maintaining good posture and body mechanics becomes key to preventing the return of symptoms.
