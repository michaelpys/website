            <p>I can understand you may have doubts about trying another treatment after experiencing headaches for so many years and having already tried many other treatments. I recommend that you contact us when your headache is at its worst as that is when you can see how well our therapy works.<br /><br />
            The purpose of our initial examination is to demonstrate to you that a disorder in your upper neck is responsible for your headache or migraine. By applying gentle yet selective mobilization to specific areas of the neck, we are generally able to temporarily reproduce your headache for a quick moment before reversing it. Using this technique can determine exactly the area of the neck that is causing your headache – there is no speculation. This lets the therapist know not only which specific segment of the neck is causing your headache, but also how to proceed with treatment.

                    I am looking for relief of my migraine, so if I don’t have a migraine when I arrive for my evaluation, why would I want you to reproduce my migraine? I want you to get rid of them, not create them.

            <p>In general, positive changes in your headache should be evident within 5-7 treatments. Eighty percent of our patients report significant improvement in this time; however, without positive changes, ongoing treatment may not be justified.</p>

            <p>I find the best results when treatments are close together; experience indicates that six treatments spread equally over three weeks is optimal. If improvement has occurred, treatment will continue with increasing intervals between the next two-three treatments. It is important to keep the upper body’s soft tissue relaxed and retrain the tissue from being in spasm to being relaxed, allowing me to palpitate the dysfunction and correct or improve the headache.<br /><br />
            It is a logical expectation that the longer you have been experiencing headaches the more treatment is required; however, this is not always the case. Regardless of whether you have been experiencing headaches for 30 years or 12 months, positive improvement is expected within 5-7 treatments.</p>

                <p>While the Pys Headache Method is recognized as a powerful approach providing the most advanced techniques to correct the disorder, it does not necessarily guarantee a successful outcome. The outcome can be affected by other factors such as the patient’s responsibility to use good posture on a daily basis. For example, sustained head/neck postures, especially neck flexion or forward bending of the head, will delay progress. Research has shown that in these positions the weight of the head on the neck increases from 10 lbs to 55 lbs. These postures as well as head and/or neck trauma place significant stress on the neck and the cervical spine. Therefore, a simple exercise/stretching program consisting of correct posture while sleeping, sitting, standing, walking and lifestyle activities often complement the precise techniques of the Pys Headache Method. I often see only short-term relief for patients who come for therapy yet are not willing to do the work of correcting their posture.</p>

                <p>Yes, in many cases, but that depends on many things such as the condition of your spine, how long you have had headaches, your lifestyle and your ability to change your posture. You may improve to the point where you feel comfortable even with an occasional mild headache. Some patients find occasional treatment, such as monthly, beneficial once they get to the point where they feel much better.</p>

            <p>I am not against patients taking medicine when needed. I realize there is a place for medicine in the treatment of headaches; however, medicine should not be the only treatment as it treats the symptoms and not the cause.<br /><br />
            It is best not to take medication the day of your assessment or treatment so as not to mask your symptoms. Some of my patients find there is no longer a need to take medicine once the source of their headache has been found and treatment has successfully reduced or eliminated their head pain. Other patients feel the stronger medicine is no longer needed or take it with much less frequency.</p>

            Should I apply heat or ice when I have a headache and where should I apply it, on my head or my neck?

            <p>You can put ice on your head where you feel the pain, but it is much more effective to apply it at the location causing the pain, which is the back of the neck. Lie down in a supine position placing the cold pack under the upper neck, making the cold pack fit the curve of your neck.<br /><br />
            If you have a headache with acute symptoms, put the cold pack at the back of neck and closer to the scalp. You can use an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a thin tea towel. Apply ice to the upper neck for a maximum of 15 minutes per hour and repeat hourly. Avoid direct contact with the skin to prevent ice burns.  <br /><br /> 
            If your headache has been caused by an injury, ice for the first 3 days post-injury or until inflammation has died down.<br /><br />
            Always use ice over heat if there are any signs of inflammation or swelling as ice reduces inflammation where heat can exacerbate inflammation, delay healing and increase your pain. Inflammation (swelling) is your body’s natural response to injury and crucial to the healing process. The chemicals produced in inflammation, however, along with the resulting pressure build-up, aggravate nerve endings causing pain. Ice narrows your blood vessels, therefore reducing blood flow to the affected area. This helps to reduce the build-up of inflammation in the injured region, thereby alleviating pain. It is important, however, to only ice for periods of up to 15 mins to ensure that the inflammatory healing process is still allowed to occur.<br /><br />
            Not sure how to tell if inflammation is present? Look for the physical signs of redness, pain, swelling and heat, and be aware of when your pain worsens. Pain caused by inflammation usually increases after rest (ie. first thing in the morning or at night) and reduces with gentle activity. More strenuous exercise, however, can make inflammation and pain worse.<br /><br />
            Heat is usually more effective for chronic persistent pain. It relaxes sore, overworked muscles and muscle spasms. Heat stimulates blood flow to the site of injury once inflammation has subsided. This increases the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the damaged tissue which is vital for optimum healing. Heat also relaxes painful muscle spasms which further restrict blood flow and healing. To heat the painful area, use a heating pad, sauna, hot bath or a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel. Remember to keep hydrated.<br /><br />
            Listen to your body. If ice makes you feel worse, then try heat and vice versa. Your body is very clever and has a natural tendency towards healing and health.</p>
